# gRPC Distributed System - Spring 2025

## üëá Project Description

This project implements a distributed client-server system using gRPC in Java. It builds on the starter code provided and adds the following services:

### Implemented Services:
1. **Echo Service** ‚Äì Repeats a message sent by the client.
2. **Joke Service** ‚Äì Sends jokes, allows new ones to be added.
3. **Dice Service** ‚Äì Simulates rolling single or multiple types of dice.
4. **Caesar Password Service** ‚Äì Lets users store and retrieve encrypted passwords by name.
5. **Todo Service (Custom)** ‚Äì A custom service that allows users to add, view, and remove to-do tasks.

This project fulfills all of the requirements for **Task 1**, **Task 2**, and supports testing through unit tests.

## ‚ñ∂Ô∏è How to Run the Project (Without Registry)

### Run the Server (Node)
```bash
gradle runNode
```

This runs the Node on the default port `9099`.

### Run the Client (manually interact)
```bash
gradle runClient
```

Or specify host/port (if needed):
```bash
gradle runClient -Phost=localhost -Pport=9099
```

### Run Unit Tests
```bash
gradle test
```

## üßë‚Äçüíª How to Work With the Program

After running the server and client:

1. The client will:
   - Ask how many jokes you'd like
   - Add a sample joke
   - Ask if you want to use the Dice Service (type "yes")
   - Ask if you want to use the Password Service (type "yes")
   - Ask if you want to use the Todo Service (type "yes")

2. Depending on your choices, you'll be prompted to:
   - Enter input values (e.g. number of dice, password name, task description)
   - See responses from the server (e.g. dice rolls, decrypted password, list of tasks)
